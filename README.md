# Self-Balancing Robot

### Resources

* [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/build-arduino-self-balancing-robot)
## â™¡ Planning

### Materials

* H-bridge
* Metro Express
* Accelerometer
* 9V battery
* Battery pack
* Acryllic 
* 2 motors
* Wires
* 2 wheels 
* Nuts and bolts for metro 
* Nuts and bolts for holding acryllic together

### Created Parts

[Onshape Document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5b15c4cd2f6854dc4cc32ff8/w/ed23d40d7b31ab41a2311be3/e/2e2d58ec8adab28d16997f49)

3 parts need designing. 
2 : 1 size ratio of parts. 

**Sides:** (150 mm by 80 mm) Hole on one side for battery pack wires (5 mm in diameter), slot in the middle for middle level.

**Bottom :** (170 mm by 100 mm)Two holes for the motors, and 3 holes for 9V battery holder.


**Top:** (170 mm by 80 mm) 2 holes for battery pack.

### Timeline

**WEEK 1:** Project Proposal

**WEEK 2:** The CAD design on Onshape. The design should be relatively simple since it's only 2 parts>

**WEEK 3:** Should have parts by this time. Get everything wired up with the libraries working. I don't want to underestimate the amount of time the libraries will take so this will be pushed to week 4 as well. 

**WEEK 4:** Figure out libraries and begin coding. 

**WEEK 5:** Coding

**WEEK 6:** Coding
