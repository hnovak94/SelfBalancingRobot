# Self-Balancing Robot

### Resources

* [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/build-arduino-self-balancing-robot)
## â™¡ Planning

### Materials

* H-bridge
* Metro Express
* Accelerometer
* 9V battery
* Battery pack
* Acryllic 
* 2 motors
* Wires
* 2 wheels 
* Nuts and bolts for metro 
* Nuts and bolts for holding acryllic together

### Created Parts

There will be 7 pieces of acryllic, but only 2 sides need designing.

**T-slots** on 

**Bottom:** Two holes for the motors, and 3 holes for 9V battery holder

**Middle:** 4? holes for Metro, H-bridge, and accelerometer

**Top:** Four holes for battery pack 

### Timeline

**WEEK 1:** Project Proposal

**WEEK 2:** The CAD design on Onshape. The design should be relatively simple since it's only 2 parts

**WEEK 3:** Should have parts by this time. Get everything wired up with the libraries working. I don't want to underestimate the amount of time the libraries will take so this will be pushed to week 4 as well. 

**WEEK 4**

**WEEK 5**
